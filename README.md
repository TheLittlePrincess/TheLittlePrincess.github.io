# Data Visualization Bootcamp Final Project


## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to obtain an understanding of the relationship between waste production and household income in Austin, TX. With Austin being a diverse city  growing on both ends of the rich-poor spectrum, our team wanted to determine if there is a correlation between higher income households and higher waste production in comparison to lower income homes. 


## Process 
- Created a [schema](https://github.com/TheLittlePrincess/Final_project/blob/main/screenshots/Initial_ETL.png) based on the data first gathered
- Created a Database  in AWS
- Created the tables in pgAdmin based on the QuickDBD [sql](https://github.com/TheLittlePrincess/Final_project/blob/main/Initial_ETL.sql) export
- Consolidated the zip code and income data into a single [file](https://github.com/TheLittlePrincess/Final_project/blob/main/full_zip_codes.csv)
- [Cleaned](https://github.com/TheLittlePrincess/Final_project/blob/main/waste_data_etl.ipynb) the waste collection data and filtered to only utilize the 2017 data
- We filtered and merged the garbage and waste route data into the [Routes_2017_weight data](https://github.com/TheLittlePrincess/Final_project/blob/main/routes_2017_weight.csv)  - now we have the waste weight per route
- We sampled pairs of zip codes and routes [Preliminary_zip_route_weight.csv](https://github.com/TheLittlePrincess/Final_project/blob/main/old_files/Preliminary_zip_route_weight.csv) in order to append household income data to have a preliminary dataset to run our machine learning model
- During week one, we used the extracted sample data to create a linear regression [model](https://github.com/TheLittlePrincess/Final_project/blob/main/old_files/ML_rough_model.ipynb) in order to complete a predictive analysis and to show the relationship between the variables of income and waste output 
- Once found which zipcode each route belongs to, we [aggregated](https://github.com/TheLittlePrincess/Final_project/blob/main/routes_with_zips_joined_loads_dem.ipynb) the waste weight per route per zipcode, and extracted what became the source [data](https://github.com/TheLittlePrincess/Final_project/blob/main/zips_load_demographics.csv) (zips_load_demographics) that includes the total trash output, median income, household units, and population by zipcode
- Such source data was uploaded into our [database](https://github.com/TheLittlePrincess/Final_project/blob/Database/ML_rough_model_Week2.ipynb) to feed our model
- We then split our dataset into training/testing randomly
- Through the first iteration of the  [model](https://github.com/TheLittlePrincess/Final_project/blob/main/ML_rough_model_Week2.ipynb) we concluded that there is a linear relationship when it comes to [population](https://github.com/TheLittlePrincess/Final_project/blob/main/Trash%20output%20vs%20Population.png) but [normal](https://github.com/TheLittlePrincess/Final_project/blob/main/Trash%20output%20vs%20Median%20income.png) when it comes to income
- From such output weâ€™ve started toying with PCA (Principal Component Analysis) as a better alternative since it will allow us to determine what is/are the most relevant factor(s) when it comes to trash output 
- Also, we have a set of [wireframes](https://github.com/TheLittlePrincess/Final_project/tree/main/Wireframes) to base the design of the dashboard site and have made additional progress on the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ff6geuibB3INIdmVZ1MCOf6o9UUcdfSww27aJYee5uw/edit#slide=id.gd7b3277579_0_3643)

- Html/CSS

## Resources
The reliable resources used:
- [Garbage and waste routes for City of Austin](https://data.austintexas.gov/Locations-and-Maps/Garbage-Routes/azhh-4hg8)
- [Waste collection and diversion daily report](https://data.austintexas.gov/Utilities-and-City-Services/Waste-Collection-Diversion-Report-daily-/mbnu-4wq9) 
- [Zip code boundaries for Austin](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-zip-code-latitude-and-longitude/export/?refine.state=TX&q=Austin)
- [Household income by zip code](https://www.austintexas.gov/page/demographic-data)

## Summary
After completing our ETL process with reliable and concise data, we have consolidated our data into a table that contains data by zipcode, including the trash output along with income and population data. We were then able to upload that information into our database and train a first version of our model. 
From the conclusions reached so far we are exploring PCA as an alternative for our model and will enter the last phase of the project.
